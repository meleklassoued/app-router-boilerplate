## Getting Started

To get started with this boilerplate, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using `yarn`.
3. Customize the boilerplate according to your project requirements.
4. Start building your Next.js app!

   **NOTE ðŸ”‰**

If you want to deploy your Next.js App on Vercel, you will not need a container in this case. Since Next.js is created and maintained by Vercel, you can do your deployment with ease. However, if you are looking into running your App through AWS, Google Cloud Run or other cloud providers, you will need a container.

In this boilerplate example a `Dockerfile` contains all the Instructions to deploy and run your nextjs app through another cloud providers
