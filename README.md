If you want to deploy your Next.js App on Vercel, you will not need a container in this case. Since Next.js is created and maintained by Vercel, you can do your deployment with ease. However, if you are looking into running your App through AWS, Google Cloud Run or other cloud providers, you will need a container.

In this boilerplate example a `Dockerfile` contains all the Instructions to deploy and run your nextjs app through another cloud providers
